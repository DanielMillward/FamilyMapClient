# FamilyMap Client - Cs 240 Project

This is the frontend part of a Family Map application developed for the CS 240 class at BYU. It follows [this 13 page specification](https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs240ta/fall2018/projects/family-map-server/FamilyMapServerSpecification.pdf). 

This repo is an Android application designed to interact with the server to request family data information and authentication. It then displays this information using the Google Maps API. Look at my list of repos to find the server side, also written in Java!
